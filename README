Think of a shared cell phone plan. Many people share a limited resource, with the phone company holding its breath waiting for anyone to go over the monthly caps of voice minutes, texts, or data. This is a Python module that helps maximize utilization while preventing overages. It coaches each user about whether to reduce or increase usage to fit into the monthly quota.

For now, only Verizon Wireless accounts are supported.  My goal is to eventually support all major carriers.

This library is designed for (casual?) programmers.  It's not usable right out of the box, but needs some integration with your account info and your usage/sharing scenario.

This library was tested with Python 3.2.

The demo program which does not download any real data::

    $ ./demo.py

The unit test suite::

    $ ./test-sua.py

The documentation::

    $ python
    >>> import SharedUsageAlerter
    >>> help(SharedUsageAlerter)

Finally, `vz-alerter.py` is a program that retrieves Verizon data of an account and determines alerts.
